# Semantic Role Labeling

## Vietnamese PropBank

* :scroll: [Vietnamese PropBank paper (Ha et al. 2014)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NBeJVDzj9N_kCokCXkGMAuIaUX05bF9M/view?usp=sharing)

This SRL corpus has 5,000 annotated sentences, which is much smaller than SRL corpora
of other languages. For example, the English PropBank contains about 50,000 sentences, which is ten times larger. While smaller in size, the Vietnamese PropBank has more semantic roles than the English PropBank has â€“ 25 roles compared to 21 roles. This makes the unavoidable data sparseness problem more severe for Vienamese SRL than for English SRL.
