ICFHR2018 Competition on Vietnamese Online Handwritten Text Recognition using HANDS-VNOnDB (VNOnDB in short) database is the first attempt to bring together researchers working on handwritten text recognition and provide them a proper benchmark to compare their approaches on the tasks of transcribing Vietnamese online handwritten text. The goal of this competition is to encourage the studies on Vietnamese online handwritten text recognition and analyze the different approaches of the participants. 

This competition (VNOnDB2018) is organized in the framework of the ICFHR 2018 competitions by Nakagawa Laboratory of Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Department of Computer and Information Sciences.

In order to share the ideas and systems for other researchers, we encourage all participants to present their approaches in a conference paper at ICFHR 2018 and also publish their source codes after the competition results have been announced.
